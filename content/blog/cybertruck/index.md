# Tesla Cybertruck Takes off with 200,000 Orders

### Or that’s what Elon Musk claims. Anyway, the divisive Tesla Cyrbertruck is one hell of a topic to discuss everywhere.
The Tesla Cyrbertruck is probably the most-memed and most-talked-about vehicle of the decade. And we have a feeling that it’s going to be the talk of the town for a long, long time. Right from the demonstration event which saw the glass windows breaking, to its boxy styling which either belongs in a 1980s sci-fi flick or in a kindergarten kid’s coloring book, the Cybertruck is making news and going viral.

There is even news of Tesla losing more than $700 million in stock prices after the misfire that the live demo was. Who thought a bunch of broken car windows could cost a manufacturer so much? Anyway, Elon Musk seems unshaken and cool as a cucumber. Just the way he handled himself on seeing the glass break, the Tesla head honcho is perhaps laughing a lot more than we know. And he has reasons for grinning.

Musk had tweeted earlier that in 24 hours since its launch, the Cybertruck grabbed 146,000 pre-orders. He recently updated the numbers stating a revised figure of 200,000. Quite evident that a lot of people are interested in pre-ordering the boxy electric truck from Tesla.
